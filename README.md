# MVDD13-Marine Vessel Detection Dataset and Benchmark for Unmanned Surface Vehicles

We introduce a new marine vessel detection dataset, termed MVDD13, which is exclusively established by deploying 35474 images. All images are accurately annotated to be 13-category vessels (cargo,
passenger, cruise, bulker, tanker, sailingboat, tug, fishing, drill, firefighting, containership,
warship and submarine). The proposed MVDD13 is equipped with benchmark features by sufficiently taking into account the reality of category proportion, image diversity, sample independence, and background confusion, etc., thereby facilitating rather deep information for training and testing USV-based visual perception for marine vessels.
